  description: |-
    Each user will be presented with a stream of photos in reverse chronological order, with information
    about when it was uploaded (date and time) and how many likes and comments it has. Users can place
    (and later remove) a “like” to photos from other users. Also, users can add comments to any photo
    (even those uploaded by themself). Comments can be removed by the author only.

    Users can ban other users. If Alice (user) bans Eve (user), Eve won’t be able to see any information
    about Alice. Alice can decide to remove the ban at any moment.

    Users will have their own personal profiles. The personal profile page for user detail: user’s photos (in
    reverse chronological order), their followers and following, and how many photos have been uploaded.
    Each user can change his/her own username, upload photos, remove photos, and follow/unfollow
    other users. Removal of a photo will also remove likes and comments.

    Users profiles can be searched via username.

    The login is perfomed by specifying the username.
